<p>Elevated blood lead levels in children is endemic in Syracuse, particularly across the cityâ€™s poorest neighborhoods and refugee communities. A big reason for this, is the aging housing stock not being properly maintained. Currently, there are 209 open cases of lead violations cited by the county health department:</p>

<p>Unresolved lead violation cases are concentrated in the Southside and Northside sectors of the city, and about half of these cases have been open since 2018 or earlier (some go back as far as 2013). See this <a href="https://iecastro.github.io/syr-lead-viol">dashboard for details</a> on each open case.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.syracuse.com/health/2019/09/want-to-fight-lead-paint-poisoning-in-syracuse-town-hall-meetings-scheduled.html">In 2018</a>, 10% of children tested had elevated blood lead - defined as five or greater micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (&gt;=5 mcg/dL). This burden, however, is not experienced equally across neighborhoods. There is a lot of variability across the 55 census-tracts in Syracuse, ranging from zero to as high as 25% of children tested having elevated blood lead.</p>
